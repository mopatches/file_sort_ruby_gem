# File Sort Ruby Gem

Sorts files too large to fit in RAM using merge sort on temporary files on the hard drive. Also known
as an external sort.

Files must be delimited text. E.g. CSV/comma-delimited or TSV/tab-delimited.

## Installation
    gem install file_sort

## Usage
    require 'file_sort'
    FileSort.new(filename, options).sort!

## Examples:
Default sort (comma-delimited file, sort by first column as a number):

    FileSort.new("my-large-file.csv").sort!

Sort with options (tab-delimited file, sort by second column as a string):

    FileSort.new("my-large-file.tsv", {
      sort_column: 1,
      column_separator: "\t",
      parse_as: :string
    }).sort!

## Options
- **sort_column** - Index for which column to use when comparing rows. Default is 0, the first column.
- **column_separator** - Character to split split on when parsing the input files. Default is ",", a comma.
- **headers** - Treat the first line as a headers line and do not include it in sorting. Defaul is false
- **inverse** - Make inverse sorting. Defaul is false
Another popular option is "\t", a tab.
- **num_processes** - Number of processes to use in parallel when sorting. Default is 3.
- **parse_as** - Determines how the parsed sort column is compared. Default is :int, other possible values: :string
- **lines_per_split** - The file to sort is split into many smaller temporary files that get sorted and merged
together. This determines the size of the temporary files, in number of lines. Default is 1000000.
- **replace_original** - Whether to replace the original file with the sorted version or not. Default is true,
to replace. If false a sorted file is left in the same directory as the original file with a .sorted extension.
- **log_output** - Show log/progress messages during sorting. Default is true, show messages.

## Tips
- **Performance:** - Set *num_processors* equal to or less than the number of cores on your computer.
Set *lines_per_split* so that the temporary files come to around 100MB each.
- **Quoted-delimited files** - Parsing quoted-delimited files (e.g. CSVs with quoted fields) is much slower than
parsing normal CSVs, so we don't. If your data needs to be quoted for the comma-separated format consider using
the tab-separated format instead.
